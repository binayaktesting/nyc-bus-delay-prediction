# nyc-bus-delay-prediction
This project analyzes over 700,000 NYC school bus delay records, merging them with weather data to find patterns, causes, and predict delays. Using data cleaning, feature engineering, and machine learning (Random Forest &amp; XGBoost), it builds prediction models and offers insights into traffic, mechanical issues, and operations inefficiencies.
